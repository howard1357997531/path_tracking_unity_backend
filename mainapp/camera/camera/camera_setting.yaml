### Camera Setting For [Intel, Kinect, ZED2], free free to add more setting.
### Some sub set of camera setting are null, in those case, it wouldn't not to use on other camera (except serial number).

baseConfig : 
  fps:
    # FPS for the camera.

    Intel: 30 
    Kinect: 30 #In some resolution setting, the fps maybe cannot archieve 30 fps. In this case, application will force convert to suitable value.
    ZED2: 30 #In some resolution setting, the fps maybe cannot archieve 30 fps. In this case, application will force convert to suitable value.

  resolution:
    #Resolution for the camera.

    Intel: 1080p # RESOLUTION mustbe [540p, 720p, 1080p], Noted that 15 fps is highest fps  when using 1440p resolution.
    Kinect: 1080p # RESOLUTION mustbe [720p, 1080p, 3072p], Noted that 15 fps is highest fps  when using 3072 resolution.
    ZED2: 1080p   # RESOLUTION mustbe [VGA, 720p, 1080p, 1440p], Noted that 15 fps is highest fps  when using 1440p resolution.

  serialNumber:
    # It auto connect current camera by official camera program when setting serialnumber as null.
    
    Intel: null  
    Kinect: null 
    ZED2: null    

  depthMode:
    Intel: true # depthMode mustbe bool type object.
    Kinect: WFOV # depthMode mustbe [WFOV_2x2, NFOV_2x2, WFOV]
    ZED2: NEURAL # depthMode mustbe [PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, ULTRA, NEURAL]       


## For external Config, maybe you need to write your own code.
externalConfig:
  # For Kinect camera
  Kinect:  
    algin: color  # Algin parameter for kinect camera, align mustbe [pointcloud, color].
    ColorFormat: BGR 

  # For ZED camera  
  ZED2:
    cameraSide: L # cameraSide mustbe [L, R] Default setting R.   
    minDepthDist: 0.3  # It is the minimum depth distance threshold for camera. current only test for ZED2.
    coordinate_units: MILLIMETER # Unit of metrics.

  # For Intel camera    
  Intel:
    min_distance: 0
    laser_power: 100
